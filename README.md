# indian_crossroads

Indian crossroads is a Python project for traffic control solution.
The project contains three jupyter notebooks:
Actor_critic.ipynb contains the Neural Network model used for training the agent.
Environment.ipynb contains the Environment used for training the agent.
Agent.ipynb contains the training function for the Actor critic algorithm.



```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

Clone the repo locally, and execute the code in the Environment.ipynb and Actor_critic.ipynb notebooks.
After that you can execute the code in the Agent.ipynb, as it imports the classes "Actor_Critic" and "Square_Crossroads".

Modify the hyperparameters and the rewards in the Square_Crossroads class to check how this affects the training.
